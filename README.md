# Project: Chess (Ruby CLI)

This is my final project for **The Odin Project** Ruby course. Itâ€™s a command-line chess game written in Ruby, implemented using object-oriented programming principles. 

## Project Goals

Build a complete chess game that runs in the command line and shows what I've learned about Ruby, OOP, and good coding practices.

### Objectives

- [ ] Two human players can play against each other in the terminal
- [ ] Prevent players from making illegal moves
- [ ] Detect and declare **check** and **checkmate**
- [ ] Allow saving and loading the game (serialization)
- [ ] Write Rspec tests for important parts of the program
- [ ] keep code modular with clean class and method design

### Extra Features (Stretch Goals)

- [ ] Add a basic AI opponent
- [ ] Use Unicode chess characters to display the board

## Tech Stack

### Language & Runtime
- Ruby
- rbenv (Ruby version manager)

### Development Tools
- Git & GitHub (version control and hosting)
- VS Code (code editor)
- Pry-byebug (debugging)
- Rubocop (code linting)
- Bundler (gem dependency management)

### Testing
- RSpec

### Serialization
